### Hey! I'm Matheus, a Software Engineer building scalable, maintainable, high quality Android apps for millions of users.

ðŸ’¬ Naturally curious, driven by passion, and multidisciplinary, as an Android developer, I consistently pursue well-designed, scalable solutions, aiming for clean, maintainable, and reusable high-quality code, adhering to best practices and design principles.

Throughout my career, I've developed Android applications and features used by millions of daily users, assisting them in performing financial activities like cross-border payments, financial market exchanges, and instant payment transactions.

Ironically, I consider myself a specialized generalist as I have also extensively studied topics in nanotechnology, industrial engineering and civil aviation. This unique blend of knowledge, coupled with solid fundamentals, fuels my critical thinking and creative problem solving skills.

If you'd like to learn more about me or any of the topics mentioned above, feel free to get in touch. I'd be more than happy to share my experience!
